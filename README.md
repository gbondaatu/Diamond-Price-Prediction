This project developed a machine learning pipeline to predict diamond prices based on physical attributes and quality-related features.
Among all input features, carat weight and physical dimensions (x, y, z) proved to be the most influential predictors.
XGBoost and the tuned Random Forest models delivered the strongest predictive performance, showing high accuracy and consistent results across cross-validation folds.
Although the results are encouraging, the models exhibit some variability and would benefit from further hyperparameter optimization.
The current framework has a good potential for real-world applications, such as powering real-time pricing tools or being adapted for other high-value products.
